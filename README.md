### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Redis Replication Lag Issues
---

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It is widely used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis replication lag issues occur when there is a delay in the synchronization of data between master and slave Redis instances. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as network latency, high load on the master, or hardware failures. When replication lag occurs, the slave Redis instances are unable to catch up with the master, resulting in data inconsistencies and potentially leading to application failures. It is important to identify and resolve replication lag issues quickly to ensure the reliability and performance of Redis-based applications.

### Parameters
```shell
export REDIS_PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export REDIS_HOST="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_BUFFER_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"

export REDIS_CONF_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Redis is running
```shell
systemctl status redis
```

### Check Redis replication status
```shell
redis-cli -h ${REDIS_HOST} -p ${REDIS_PORT} info replication
```

### Check Redis key space
```shell
redis-cli -h ${REDIS_HOST} -p ${REDIS_PORT} info keyspace
```

### Check Redis memory usage
```shell
redis-cli -h ${REDIS_HOST} -p ${REDIS_PORT} info memory
```

### Check Redis slow log
```shell
redis-cli -h ${REDIS_HOST} -p ${REDIS_PORT} slowlog get
```

### Check system memory usage
```shell
free -m
```

### Check system CPU usage
```shell
top
```

### Check network connectivity
```shell
ping ${REDIS_HOST}
```

### Check Redis configuration file
```shell
cat /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

## Repair

### Increase the replication buffer size to reduce the number of missed commands.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the Redis configuration file path

REDIS_CONF=${REDIS_CONF_FILE_PATH}



# Set the replication buffer size

REPL_BUFFER_SIZE=${NEW_BUFFER_SIZE}



# Update the Redis configuration file with the new replication buffer size

sed -i "s/^repl-backlog-size .*/repl-backlog-size $REPL_BUFFER_SIZE/" $REDIS_CONF



# Restart the Redis service to apply the changes

service redis restart


```
